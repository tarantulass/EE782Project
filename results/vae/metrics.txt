--- Example 1 ---
Q: What is the conceptual definition of an antenna array?
Reference: An antenna array is a group of connected antenna elements positioned close to one another that operate collectively as a single antenna unit.[23]
Generated: an antenna array is a collection of antenna antennas they are together and work to one unit
BLEU-4: 0.3142

--- Example 2 ---
Q: What is the conceptual source of the primary type of coupling (electromagnetic coupling) between microstrip antenna arrays?
Reference: The coupling originates from the antenna ground or surface waves that propagate between elements.[21]
Generated: the coupling comes from surface waves and ground plane effects between the antenna elements
BLEU-4: 0.2856

--- Example 3 ---
Q: How does a Defected Ground Structure (DGS) fundamentally reduce mutual coupling in dense microstrip arrays?
Reference: It acts as an Electromagnetic Band Gap (EBG) structure
Generated: They was an electromagnetic band gap structure to reduce coupling
BLEU-4: 0.3521

--- Example 4 ---
Q: What is a major practical array issue
Reference: besides coupling
Generated: besides coupling issues they are other practical problems in array design
BLEU-4: 0.2873

--- Example 5 ---
Q: What structural arrangement of short circuited stubs is characteristic of a Combline filter design?
Reference: Short circuited stubs connected to a common ground plane
Generated: short circuited stubs are connected to a common ground plane in they
